# Virtual-Assistant
A virtual assistant, also called AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application 
program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user. Virtual 
assistants typically perform simple jobs for end users, such as adding tasks to a calendar; providing 
information that would normally be searched in a web browser; or controlling and checking the status 
of smart home devices, including lights, cameras and thermostats.Users also task virtual assistants to 
make and receive phone calls, create text messages, get directions, hear news and weather reports, find 
hotels or restaurants, check flight reservations, hear music, or play games.
